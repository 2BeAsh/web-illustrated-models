# Interactive models
Tool for visualizing models published by the Biocomplexity department at the Niels Bohr Institute.


## Project scope
- Frontend: A web-interface where one can interact with models.
- Backend: New models can be added easily without too much work from the modelers' side.
- Desired look. Common theme (e.g. all particles are ret dots)? Customizable?
- How should the models be visualized?
- How much interactivity is desired? Slider that changes parameter values or more?


## Tools
- *Frontend*: Vue.js
- *Backend*: Flask
- *Visualization*: ***ask prof. about their needs before deciding***
- *Deployment*: Maybe through KU?
